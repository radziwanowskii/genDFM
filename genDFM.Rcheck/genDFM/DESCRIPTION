Description: genDFM is a general package to estimate dynamic factor models in R.
    We provide a set of functions to estimate the model, plot the components or compute 
    forecasts. We provide a wide range of information criteria for the choice of the
    factors. In addition, the package allows for estimation of Factor Augmented
    Vector Autoregressions and computation of the IRFs. The core of the package is written in C++ and uses the Armadillo library.
