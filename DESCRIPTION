Description: Dynamic Factor Models are one of the most popular tools for the analysis of high-dimensional data. 
    The genDFM package provides a general framework for estimating a wide range of dynamic factor models as well as
    numerous functions for estimating the number of factors. The core of the package is written in C++, the package 
    inherits several function from the 'dfms' and 'fnets' packages.
